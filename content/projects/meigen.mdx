```ts
import { Tinybird } from "@chronark/zod-bird";
import { z } from "zod";

const tb = new Tinybird({ token: "token" });

export const getEvents = tb.buildPipe({
  pipe: "get_events__v1",
  parameters: z.object({
    tenantId: z.string(),
  }),
  data: z.object({
    event: z.string(),
    time: z.number().transform((t) => new Date(t)),
  }),
});


const res = await getEvents({ tenantId: "chronark" })

// res.data = {event: string, time: Date}[]
